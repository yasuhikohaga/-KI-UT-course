This article is about developing a new method to quantify mutual exclusivity between two genes from sparse scRNA-seq data.
The authors said this new method provides new biological insights.

In this article, scRNA-seq was used.

I have some questions.
First, are there some new biological findings applying this method?
Secondly, can this method apply to not drop-base scRNA-seq? Or this is not the purpose of this method?
Lastly, is this method used now? And, if not, why?
PS. I am not familiar with methods, so if I have weird questions, please forgive me.
